# Parking Information

We provide secure on-site parking with cameras for €10 per night. Don't worry, the parking is underground, so there is no weather impact on your vehicle.

## General Overview

The hotel has an underground parking garage located directly below the building. It is suitable for regular passenger cars and small SUVs. Because it is underground, your vehicle is protected from rain, snow, and direct sunlight.

Parking is intended primarily for hotel guests, but in some cases day visitors may also use it if there is free space. Availability can vary on busy dates.

## Security and Access

The parking area is covered by CCTV cameras and is not open to the general public. Only guests with an active room key or a valid parking code can enter. The entrance gate is operated via:
- Room key card, or
- PIN code provided at reception.

For extra safety, the parking gates remain closed at all times and automatically lock after each vehicle passes through.

## Pricing and Payment

- Standard price for hotel guests: **€10 per night per vehicle**.
- The fee is charged to your room bill and can be settled at check-out.
- Short arrivals (for example, dropping off luggage) are usually allowed for a few minutes free of charge in the front area, but not for long-term parking.

If you plan to arrive with more than one car, please inform reception in advance so we can confirm that there is enough space.

## Height and Vehicle Limits

The underground garage has a typical urban height limit suitable for most standard cars. Very large vans or vehicles with high roof racks may not fit. If you are travelling with an oversized vehicle, it is best to contact the hotel before arrival so we can advise whether parking is possible or suggest alternatives.

## How to Use the Parking on Arrival

1. Drive up to the hotel entrance.
2. If the gate is closed, use the intercom to contact reception.
3. The reception team will open the gate and guide you to park.
4. After check-in, your room key or a PIN code will allow you to enter and exit freely during your stay.

## Additional Notes

- The hotel is not responsible for valuables left inside the car, so please do not leave important personal items visible.
- Please always park within the marked lines to ensure smooth traffic.
- If you have mobility needs and require a space closer to the elevator, mention this at check-in so we can assign a suitable spot if available.
