# Cancellation Policy

Please note that all reservations are non-refundable. Cancellations will incur the full charge of the booking.

## Non-Refundable Reservations

Most of our standard rates are **non-refundable**:
- Once the booking is confirmed and charged, the amount is not returned if you cancel or fail to arrive.
- This applies regardless of the reason for cancellation, including changes of plans or transport issues.

Because of this, we recommend that guests double-check travel dates and any visa or transport requirements before finalising the booking.

## Changes and No-Shows

- A **cancellation** or **no-show** (not arriving on the first day of the booking without prior notice) is charged at **100% of the total reservation cost**.
- In many cases, shortening the stay after arrival is also treated as a partial cancellation and may not lead to a refund for unused nights.

If you anticipate a possible delay or change, it is best to contact the hotel as early as possible. While the official policy is strict, the team can sometimes help with practical suggestions (for example, adjusting check-in time or changing the guest name on the booking), as long as it does not affect the non-refundable payment.

## Travel Insurance

Because the reservations are non-refundable, we recommend that guests consider travel insurance or other protection that covers unexpected changes, health issues, or transport disruptions. This way, if something serious happens, you may be able to recover some costs through your insurer even if the hotel cannot refund the stay.
