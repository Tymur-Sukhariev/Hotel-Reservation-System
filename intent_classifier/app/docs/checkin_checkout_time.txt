# Check-In and Check-Out Information

Check-in is available from **3:00 PM**, and check-out is until **12:00 AM**. Early check-in and late check-out are subject to availability on the day of arrival and departure. We will do our best to accommodate your request.

## Check-In

- **Standard check-in time:** from 3:00 PM (local time).
- Rooms are usually prepared by this time. If you arrive earlier, you are welcome to leave your luggage at reception and use the lobby or explore the city.
- During check-in, guests are asked to provide an ID document and a payment method for any extras (such as parking, spa access, or minibar use).
- If you expect to arrive late in the evening or at night, it is helpful to inform the hotel in advance. This allows the team to keep your room reserved and prepared for late arrival.

## Early Check-In

Early check-in before 3:00 PM is **not guaranteed** and depends on how full the hotel is and whether the previous guest has already checked out.
- If the room is ready when you arrive, the team will happily check you in early.
- If not, your luggage can be stored safely at no additional cost until your room becomes available.
- In some cases, a small extra fee might apply for very early morning check-ins, especially if this effectively blocks the room from the previous night.

## Check-Out

- **Standard check-out time:** until 12:00 AM (local time) as stated in our policy.
- Guests are kindly asked to bring their key cards back to reception and settle any remaining charges (parking, restaurant, extras).
- After check-out, you may still leave your luggage at reception for a few hours if you have a later train, flight, or meeting.

## Late Check-Out

Late check-out is handled case by case:
- It depends on the booking situation and whether the room is needed for the next guest.
- If possible, we may extend check-out by a few hours without an additional fee.
- For longer extensions, an extra charge may apply (for example, a half-day fee).

Guests who know in advance that they need a later departure time are encouraged to ask as early as possible, either at check-in or via our chat.

## Practical Tips

- If you need to check out very early in the morning, reception can prepare your invoice the evening before to speed things up.
- Always double-check your travel times and local time zone when planning arrival and departure.
