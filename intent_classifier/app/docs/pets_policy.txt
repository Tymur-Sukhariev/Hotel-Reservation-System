# Pets Policy

We are a pet-friendly hotel! Small pets are welcome with an additional cleaning fee of €20 per stay.

## General Rules

- We accept **small pets**, such as small dogs or cats. Very large animals are not suitable for the rooms and corridors of the hotel.
- There is a one-time **cleaning fee of €20 per stay** when you bring a pet. This helps us cover the additional cleaning needed after check-out.
- Guests are responsible for the behaviour of their pets and for any damage caused.

## In the Room

Pets may stay with you in your room:
- Please do not leave pets alone for very long periods, especially if they may bark or scratch.
- Furniture, beds, and sofas are primarily for guests; using your own blanket or pet bed is recommended.
- If extra cleaning is required due to heavy shedding, accidents, or damage, an additional charge may apply.

## Public Areas

- Pets should be kept **on a leash** or in a carrier when moving around hallways and public spaces.
- For hygiene reasons, pets are usually **not allowed in the main restaurant or spa area**. However, some lobby or terrace areas may be pet-friendly; the staff can show you where you can sit with your pet.
- Guests should always pick up after their animals both inside and outside the property.

## Booking with Pets

When making a reservation, it is helpful to:
- Mention that you are travelling with a pet.
- Indicate the type and approximate size of the animal.

This allows us to assign a more suitable room (for example, one closer to the elevator or with easier outdoor access).

If you have questions about whether your pet is acceptable or need clarification on the rules, you can contact the hotel before booking or ask directly in the chat.
